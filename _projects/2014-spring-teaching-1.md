This is a description of a teaching experience. You can use markdown like any other post.
=======
Pose estimation is one of the most basic steps when interfacing a camera with respect to the world. It has seen an increase in usage with the development of autonomy across various fields, mainly robotics. This thesis proposes to compare the various 2d-3d point correspondence methods for pose estimation available to us using three different conditions: distance from camera, resolution and pattern used. There is no documentation available today that describes which pattern, distance and algorithm configuration gives us the best results possible.

 After getting various correspondences, a hand-eye calibration will be performed and then later used for testing which correspondence environment produces the most accurate results. Accuracy would be the metric used to calculate the results produced from the correspondence algorithms.
### Methodology

---
10 waypoints were chosen for calibration such that they spanned toward the extreme points of the cameraâ€™s view.

**Position of Camera**

Two fixed positions of the camera were taken into consideration.

- 100cm from the base of the robot
- 150cm from the base of the robot
The minimum distance for the camera to produce a good and stable point cloud was calculated to be 1m, thus these distances were taken accordingly.
The camera was placed on a tripod with an angle of 30 deg.
