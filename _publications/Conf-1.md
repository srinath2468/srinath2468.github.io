### Abstract

This  paper  describes  IFOR  (Intelligent  Flying  Object  for  Reconnaissance)  an autonomous  aerial  vehicle  that  has  been  developed  by  Team  IFOR  at  BITS  Pilani, Dubai  Campus.  The  vehicle  being  discussed  in  this  paper  is  able  to  localize  and navigate  in  an  indoor  GPS  denied  sterile  environment.  Downward  facing  Optical Flow  sensor  Px4Flow  is  used  to  localize  and  stabilize  the  attitude  (pitch,  roll  and yaw)  and  altitude  of  the  vehicle  using  PID  controllers.  Ground  robot  detection  is carried  out  by  two  inclined  forward  facing  cameras  and  uses  a  LIDAR  to  avoid obstacle  ground  robots  by  setting  the  area  near  the  paths  of  obstacle  ground  robots as  hazardous  area.
